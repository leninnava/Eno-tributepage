        <p>When you think about it, recorded music is something of a historical oddity. Imagine telling a visitor from
            1650 that we like to listen to the exact same performances, over and over again, without any variation --
            they might well be baffled. Or, as Brian Eno once said, perhaps it is our grandchildren who will be the
            baffled ones.</p>


        <p>Scape, a musical app developed by Eno alongside composer and programmer Peter Chilvers, is a kind of
            album that will never sound the same twice. It's a continuation of Eno's work with generative music,
            compositions which change every time they're played as the systems behind them introduce some kind of
            randomness. Starting with an empty screen, shapes can be arranged to create literal "soundscapes" where
            they each represent a different sound. Their positions relative to each other dictate their behaviour.</p>

        <p>Eno, one of popular music's most important and influential figures, has used generative techniques to
            compose music for many years, popularising the term with the album Generative Music 1 in 1996. Chilvers and
            Eno first worked together on the soundtrack to Spore, where the generative music matched the sandbox
            evolution of the gameplay. They then worked together on apps called Trope and Bloom, both more primitive
            versions of the "soundscape" idea behind Scape.

            We're used to the ideas of live music versus recorded music, and the different expectations they bring, but
            generative music introduces the unpredictablity of live playing to machines. The description of Scape as
            "music that thinks for itself" imbues computers with a kind of creative responsibility, which might seem a
            contentious notion. Can an algorithm be creative in a way that we would recognise?</p>
